When you have some free time as I have been fortunate to have recently, your mind starts to meander and wander over all the projects and ideas
you've had. And out of nowhere comes an incredible idea - I'll create a statechart of Williams' original Defender game!

Not exactly a ground breaking thing to do - but bear with, I have some interesting ideas about architecture and partitioning that I want to explore
and an old-school game provides a simple - but not too simple - model



I really like the approach here http://prog21.dadgum.com/23.html
and I like the idea that programming is ultimately an organizational task not a creative one - but that's another story.
