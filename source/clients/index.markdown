<h3>GSEA</h3>

[{% img right /images/gsea/landing_page_thumb.png 400 Landing Page%}](https://www.gseaonline.com)

GSEA needed a fast and responsive web application to help provide IT tools and services primarily to the charity sector. They wanted a customer facing subscription-based webstore and a back-end that streamlines their work flow. I used Laravel and Angular, with Braintree, LDAP and IceWarp integrations.
